Flashmenu

Whats the idea?

    * The visual metaphor of a house serves to build the image of the “safeplace” on the internet that Cyberhus strives to be. The focus on the visual at the same time seeks to welcome users that prefer images to words.
    * The purpose of using Flash menus in Cyberhus, is to extend the visual metaphor of the house to integrate navigation and browsing in order to make it a natural part of the visual experience of exploring a house.
    * Each 3D-rendered scene is then transformed into the front page of a theme-specific subsection of the site eg. counselling in “Stuen”.
    * Integrating content dynamically from our CMS-system into the Flash-menu empowers us to emphasize content on the front pages of Cyberhus in a visually pleasing way that - hopefully - invites the user to interaction.
